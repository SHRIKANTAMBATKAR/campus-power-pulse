Campus Power Pulse, SIH Prototype

This repository contains the prototype for my Smart India Hackathon submission, Campus Power Pulse. The project tracks and manages electricity usage inside a campus and provides insights to reduce power waste.

Overview

Campus Power Pulse helps monitor power consumption in different campus areas such as classrooms, labs, hostels, and admin blocks. It uses sensor data or manual entries to show usage trends, detect unusual spikes, and guide energy saving decisions.

Features

Dashboard for real time or recorded power usage.

Visual charts for daily, weekly, and monthly consumption.

Alerts for abnormal electricity spikes.

Basic prediction module for future energy demand.

Simple UI to view, compare, and analyze campus power data.

How it works

Power data is collected from sensors or sample CSVs.

The backend processes data and generates insights.

A minimal ML model predicts future usage based on patterns.

The frontend displays graphs, alerts, and summaries.


Purpose

This prototype is created for SIH PPT submission. It focuses on the idea, workflow, and demonstration, not full deployment.
